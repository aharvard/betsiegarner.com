<p>I’m an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Tennessee Tech University.  I received my PhD in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2017, my MA in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013, and my BA in sociology from Emory University in 2011.</p>

<p>I use qualitative research methods to study topics related to family, culture, and place.  My work has been published in <cite>Study the South</cite>, <cite>Sociology Compass</cite>, <cite>The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</cite>, <cite>Social Psychology Quarterly</cite>, and <cite>Qualitative Sociology</cite>.</p>

<p>I’m the recipient of a Dissertation Research Fellowship and multiple Otto and Gertrude Pollak Summer Research Fellowships from the University of Pennsylvania, as well as a Charles Elias Shepard Scholarship for Graduate Study from Emory University.</p>

<p>The University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences named me a 2016 Dean’s Scholar.  Along with a colleague, I received the 2017 Award for Distinguished Scholarship from the Animals and Society section of the American Sociological Association.</p>

<p>I teach Introduction to Sociology, Introduction to Women and Gender Studies, and additional courses on culture and inequality.  In serving a diverse student population, I draw on design thinking and inclusive teaching to mitigate inequalities that arise from variation in college preparedness.</p>

I also serve as the faculty adviser for my department’s chapter of Alpha Kappa Delta International Sociology Honor Society.</p>
