<p>During my senior year at Emory University, I completed the College Honors Program in sociology.  This was my first experience conducting a professional academic study from beginning to end, including everything from research design and IRB approval to writing a thesis and presenting at a conference.</p>

<p>My research project was inspired by an observation Gloria Steinem made in her 1984 national bestseller <a href="" class="italic">Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions</a>: “I’ve yet to be on a campus where most women weren’t worrying about some aspect of combining marriage, children, and a career.  I’ve yet to find one where many men were worrying about the same thing.”</p>

<p>I was familiar with recent scholarship on gender, work, and family through my courses as an undergraduate sociology major, but most of those studies focused on the experiences of men and women who were already married and raising children.  There was very little research available on the views of contemporary young adults like my college peers.</p>

<p>I wanted to know if things had changed since the 1970s and 80s, so I designed an interview study of college seniors and their approaches to work-family balance.  I conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 students, 10 women and 10 men, asking them open-ended questions about their career aspirations and plans for family.  The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim, and I used MAXQDA to code the interview transcripts using themes that were arrived at both inductively and deductively.</p>

<p>What I found is that gender accounts for a significant difference in how students responded: women anticipated making difficult choices in order to resolve conflicts between work and family, but men imagined they would easily “have it all” without making any personal sacrifices.</p>

<p>This insight has meaningful implications for policy makers and advocates working to support parents, especially mothers, as they negotiate the competing demands of work and family.  For example, it provides empirical evidence that college students have changed very little in their thinking about this issue in recent decades.  At the same time however, it suggests that college may represent a time in the life course that is ripe for intervention given that young adults at this point are formulating their career aspirations and plans for family but not yet committed to particular work-family arrangements.</p>

<p>When I first moved to Philadelphia to attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania, I spent a lot of my free time visiting the city’s many world-class museums.  I was struck by the interactive designs of the exhibits and marveled at how children appeared to relish learning through play.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I needed a topic for my master’s thesis and began to wonder about how parents experience family visits to museums.  Is it as much for the parents as it is for the kids?  The available sociological research on family had very little to say about such public contexts as museums.  Instead, it was more common for scholars to study parents and children at home or in school settings.</p>

<p>To gain leverage on my question, I conducted 120+ hours of ethnographic fieldwork at four museum sites, using participant observation in two distinct modes.  First, I worked as a trained volunteer at one museum exhibit, which required me to lead parents and children through structured educational activities and also gave me the chance to discuss museum visits with them more generally.  Second, I visited museums as a regular patron in the company of a colleague’s young son.  Since I had no children of my own, this strategy allowed me to <a href="">“wedge”</a> my way into child-focused museum activities.</p>

<p>In both modes, I used a combination of direct questioning and <a href="">“interviewing by comment”</a> to elicit meaningful conversation with parents.  I made jottings while still in the field and later wrote up extensive field notes at home.  Using MAXQDA, I coded and recoded successive sets of field notes in an inductive process that resulted in a refined coding scheme.</p>

<p>My findings reveal that fathers experience family museum visits as sentimental leisure time while mothers experience those same visits as routine parenting work.  Fathers focused on playfully interacting with their children and romanticized museum visits as special, memorable events.  But mothers spent most of their time managing their children, as well as their husbands, and therefore rationalized museum visits as mundane and ordinary.</p>

<p>This evidence not only illustrates how gendered patterns of meaning-making pervade experiences of mothering and fathering, but also sparks an important debate about the methods typically used to measure how parents spend their time.  Data from large surveys of time-use are often analyzed using research-imposed codes, and at least <a href="">one noteworthy study</a> categorizes family museum visits as leisure time, not work time.  By using a grounded theory approach that prioritizes parents’ own subjective experiences, I found that conventional time-diary methods likely overestimate leisure time for mothers while also obscuring from view the valuable work mothers perform during so-called family leisure activities.</p>

<p>During my time in graduate school I had the opportunity to collaborate with Associate Professor of Sociology David Grazian on a topic reflecting the intersection of our respective research interests.  Dave was working on a larger <a href="">book project</a> about the culture of nature in American zoos, and he hired me to work as a research assistant helping to collect and analyze data.  Given my own interest in family leisure, the two of us agreed that I would take the lead on planning a co-authored paper about parenting at the zoo.</p>

<p>The data for our paper was collected through 100+ hours of public observation at an urban zoo, conducted by a research team that included me and two other students.  Members of the research team were stationed at individual exhibits and observed how families with children responded to animal displays and interacted with one another.  Each of the field observers wrote up detailed field notes which were all coded and analyzed by Dave and me using MAXQDA.</p>

<p>The theme of children’s gender socialization emerged early in the project as we observed parents projecting traditional, heteronormative cultures of human gender difference onto “wild” zoo animals.  As a socialization message, this association teaches children to accept socially constructed differences between men and women, boys and girls as biologically determined by the natural living world.</p>

<p>Scholars had long-bemoaned the stubborn appeal of natural explanations for social phenomenon, but sociologists had yet to identify how socialization results in a worldview that so frequently mistakes gender differences as natural rather than social.  Our work opens up new avenues for research on how anthropomorphized representations of non-human animal species contribute to the widespread misconception that human gender differences are explained by biological, rather than cultural, causes.</p>
