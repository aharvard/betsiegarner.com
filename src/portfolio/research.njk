<p>During my senior year of college at Emory University, I completed the Honors Program through the Department of Sociology.  This was my first experience conducting a professional academic study from beginning to end, including everything from research design and IRB approval to writing up results and presenting at a conference.</p>

<p>My research project was inspired by an observation Gloria Steinem made in her 1984 national bestseller <em>Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions</em>: “I’ve yet to be on a campus where most women weren’t worrying about some aspect of combining marriage, children, and a career.  I’ve yet to find one where many men were worrying about the same thing.”</p>

<p>I was familiar with recent scholarship on gender, work, and family through my coursework as an undergraduate sociology major, but most of that research focused on the experiences of men and women who were already married and raising children.  There was very little research available on the views of contemporary young adults like my college peers.</p>

<p>I wondered if things had changed since the 1970s and 80s, so I designed an interview study of college seniors and their approaches to work-family balance.  I conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 students, 10 women and 10 men, asking them open-ended questions about their career aspirations and plans for family.  The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim, and I used MAXQDA to code the interview transcripts using themes that were arrived at both inductively and deductively.</p>

<p>What I found is that gender accounted for a significant difference in how students responded: women anticipated making difficult choices in order to resolve conflicts between work and family, but men imagined they would easily “have it all” without making any personal sacrifices.</p>

<p>This insight has meaningful implications for policy makers and advocates working to support parents, especially mothers, as they negotiate the competing demands of work and family.  For example, it provides empirical evidence that college students have apparently changed very little in their thinking on this issue in recent decades.  At the same time however, it suggests that college may represent a time in the life course that is ripe for intervention given that young adults at this point are formulating their career aspirations and plans for family but not yet committed to particular work-family arrangements.</p>

<p>When I moved to Philadelphia to attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania, I spent a lot of my free time visiting the city’s many world-class museums.  I was struck by the interactive design of the exhibits and marveled at how children appeared to relish learning through play.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I needed a topic for my research project in a field methods course and began to wonder about how parents experience their family visits to museums.  Is it as much for the parents as it is for the kids?  The available sociological research on family had very little to say about such public contexts as museums.  Instead, it was more common for scholars to study parents and children in their homes or as they interface with schools.</p>

<p>To explore the perspective of parents, I conducted 120+ hours of ethnographic fieldwork at four museum sites and used participant observation in two distinct modes.  First, I worked as a trained volunteer at one museum exhibit, which required me to lead parents and children through structured educational activities and also gave me the chance to discuss museum visits with them more generally.  Second, I visited museums as a regular patron in the company of a colleague’s young son.  Since I had no children of my own, this strategy allowed me to “wedge” my way into child-focused museum activities.</p>

<p>In both modes, I used a combination of direct questioning and “interviewing by comment” to elicit meaningful conversation with parents.  I made jottings while still in the field and then later wrote up extensive field notes at home.  Using MAXQDA, I coded and recoded successive sets of field notes in an inductive process that resulted in a refined coding scheme.</p>
